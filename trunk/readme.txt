IG Portfolio is a clean and easy-to-use portfolio plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==
IG Portfolio is a clean and simply project showcase management system for WordPress. You can display your projects adding description, images and project details and display them with the shortcodes included. IG Portfolio includes a widget to show your recent projects, a widget to list your portfolio categories and a widget to show your project details (that is shown in the single project page). You can create your portfolio's page and show your projects with the portfolio shortcode, you can also show your projects as an image gallery selecting the categories that you want to show.
IG Portfolio works like a charm with all our themes but also with others WordPress themes thanks to its simplicity and to the clean design.
